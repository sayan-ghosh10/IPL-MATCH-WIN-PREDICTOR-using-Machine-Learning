# IPL-MATCH-WIN-PREDICTOR
It is a webpage which shows the win probability of the ipl  team which is batting second  or chasing the target in that specific match in terms of percentage.
We have used a dataset from Kaggle of all the matches and teams in IPL from 2008-2019.
We have used Pandas library in Python to clean the dataset of all the unnecessary information and form a final dataframe.
We then use Scikit Learn library to form the model using Linear Regression algorithm.
We have used Pickle to drop the model.
We represent the model through an app developed using Streamlit.
The model has a 80% accuracy approximately.
